# Recomendify â€“ Spotify Recommender Engine (Go)

**Recomendify** is a command-line application built in Go that models a music recommendation system using graph-based structures. Based on real data from a Spotify public dataset, the program analyzes user-song relationships and enables features like shortest paths, recommendations, and cycle detection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course at the University of Buenos Aires. It emphasizes data modeling, graph algorithms, and efficiency in handling large-scale input data (~2 million entries).

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- **Shortest path between songs** using BFS, treating users and playlists as connectors
- **Global song ranking** via PageRank (or HITS)
- **Personalized recommendations** for users or songs using Personalized PageRank
- **Song similarity analysis**: list songs exactly `n` hops away
- **Cycle detection**: find a cycle of length `n` starting from a song

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Format

Input is a TSV file with columns:

ID USER_ID TRACK_NAME ARTIST PLAYLIST_ID PLAYLIST_NAME GENRES

Each row maps a song to a user-created playlist. Songs may appear in multiple playlists and users may create multiple playlists.

## ðŸ§  Graph Models

- **Bipartite Graph (Usersâ€“Songs):**  
  Edges between users and songs they added to any playlist.

- **Song Graph:**  
  Undirected edges between songs that appear in playlists from the same user.

These models enable traversal and recommendation logic.

## ðŸ’» Usage

```bash
$ ./recomendify.py spotify-mini.tsv
```

Then, commands are entered via stdin (or redirected from a file):

ðŸ”¹ **Shortest Path**

```camino <song1> >>>> <song2>```

Finds the shortest connection between two songs via users and playlists.

ðŸ”¹ **Most Important Songs**

```mas_importantes <n>```

Lists the top n most central songs using PageRank.

ðŸ”¹ **Personalized Recommendation**

```recomendacion canciones <n> <song1> >>>> <song2> >>>> ...```

```recomendacion usuarios <n> <song1> >>>> <song2> >>>> ...```

Recommends songs or users based on personalized PageRank from a given song list.

ðŸ”¹ **Cycle Detection**

```ciclo <n> <song>```

Finds a cycle of exactly n songs starting and ending at the given song.

ðŸ”¹ **Songs at Exact Distance**

```rango <n> <song>```

Counts how many songs are exactly n hops away in the song similarity graph.
