# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of data structure implementations and projects developed as part of my coursework for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)**. I am currently studying **Software Engineering** at the **Faculty of Engineering (FIUBA)**.

## Contents

The data_structures subdirectory contains the implementations of different abstract data types (ADT): stack, queue, linked list, hash map, binary search tree (BST). 

Each of the other subdirectories contain projects developed as part of the same coursework, using the ADTs implemented in data_structures.

The modules are implemented in Go, except for the ADT Graph and the Spotify Recommender Engine (recommendify) which were implemented in Python.

## Disclaimer

The projects in this repository were developed as part of the academic coursework for the *Algorithms and Data Structures* course at the University of Buenos Aires. Its primary purpose is to explore and apply theoretical concepts in a controlled learning environment. As such, it is not intended to serve as a production-ready or comprehensive solution for real-world deployment.
